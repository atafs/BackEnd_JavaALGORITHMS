Thanks for the opportunity to make this exercise.

Features:
- I have a dao class to save name and distance in minutes .
- From a fixed point (used as reference) to the train station.

- I have enums to introduces delay is certain routes.
(when analysing the data, identified values from certain that didn´t mach).
(so I introduced them as delay (like if the train passes in a slower passage).
(or the opposite, in a faster pace).

- I have a main class in order to run my application.

- I have a class that will manage routes.
(where from and where to is a train going. And makes the necessary calculation).

- Finally a class to make JUnit test
(assure quality of code in terms of logic (basic test)
(with more time and if necessary, could add a wider variety of tests)
